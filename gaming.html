           <h4 style="color:white;">WHAT IS ZOMBS ROYALE.IO?
           <ul>
             <li>
               Zombs Royale is a free-to-play multiplayer battle royale game developed by Arcade and released in 2018. It takes place in a 2D top-down perspective and draws inspiration from the popular battle royale genre, but with a simplified, pixel-art style. The gameâ€™s bright, pixelated visuals make it both accessible and appealing to a wide range of players, providing a fun and fast-paced experience.</li><hr>

Gameplay
<li>In Zombs Royale, players compete against each other to be the last one standing on a shrinking map. Each match starts with players being dropped onto the map from a random location, where they must scavenge for weapons, armor, and health packs. Players need to be constantly aware of the shrinking safe zone, which forces everyone into tighter spaces, eventually leading to intense and unpredictable battles.

The game is fast-paced, with each match lasting around 5-10 minutes. The core mechanics are simple:</li>
<li>Movement is controlled with the keyboard (WASD or arrow keys).</li>
<li>Aiming and shooting are controlled with the mouse.</li>
<li>No building: Unlike other battle royale games like Fortnite, Zombs Royale does not have building mechanics, focusing purely on combat and survival.</li><hr>

<li>Players can choose from different game modes:</li>
<li>Solo: Compete individually against other players.</li>

<li>Duo: Team up with a friend and take on other duos.</li>
<li>Squad: Join forces with a group of up to four players and work together to survive.</li>
<li>Special Modes: There are often limited-time events and modes with unique challenges and rules.</li><hr>

Map

<li>The Zombs Royale map is randomly generated at the beginning of each match, ensuring that every game offers a different experience. The map features a variety of environments, each offering unique opportunities for loot and strategy:</li>
<li>Urban Areas: Towns, warehouses, and factories provide plenty of buildings to explore and loot.</li>

<li>Forests and Rural Zones: These areas are more open, making them ideal for ambushes or stealthy gameplay.</li>
<li>Industrial Zones: Places with high loot potential but usually heavy competition.</li>
<li>Hazard Zones: Specific areas that can be more dangerous, often having higher loot but drawing more players.</li>

<li>As the match progresses, the safe zone will shrink, forcing all players to converge on a smaller area. Those caught outside the safe zone will take damage over time, increasing the urgency to find a safe location. This mechanic ensures that all matches remain fast-paced and intense, with the action ramping up as time goes on.</li><hr>

Characters
<li>In Zombs Royale, players can customize their characters with a range of cosmetic items but there is no stat-based progression. Every player starts with the same basic abilities, so skill, strategy, and quick decision-making are the primary factors in determining success. Players can change their appearance with a variety of skins, emotes, and other cosmetic accessories. Some of the customization options include:</li>
<li>Outfits: Choose from a variety of skins, ranging from military gear to fun, quirky costumes.</li>
<li>Backpacks and Hats: These add an extra layer of personalization.</li>
<li>Emotes: Fun animations to express yourself, whether taunting an opponent or celebrating a victory.</li>
<li>The game's cosmetic items are earned through XP progression, seasonal challenges, or microtransactions, but none of them offer a competitive advantage, ensuring the game stays fair.
</li><hr>
Weapons & Items
<li>Zombs Royale offers a wide array of weapons and items to help players survive:<li>
<li>Weapons: The game features classic battle royale weapons like pistols, SMGs, shotguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and more. The rarity of weapons is color-coded, ranging from common (gray) to legendary (gold).</li>

<li>Healing Items: Players can find health packs, medkits, and shields that regenerate health and provide extra protection.</li>
<li>Special Items: These include grenades, rocket launchers, traps, and armor upgrades. The variety of items allows for a strategic approach to combat.</li>
<li>Ammo: Managing ammo is crucial; running out of bullets in the middle of a fight can be deadly, so players must carefully manage their resources.</li><hr>

Match Dynamics & Strategy

<li>Quick Combat: Each game is fast-paced and focused on immediate combat, with little downtime between engagements. Players must constantly be on the lookout for enemies, avoid ambushes, and strategically choose when to fight or flee.</li>
<li>Survival: While the map starts off large, the shrinking safe zone means players will inevitably be forced into close quarters. This mechanic creates constant tension and ensures that battles are never too far away from each other.</li>

<li>Looting and Resource Management: Scavenging for weapons and supplies is a key element of the game. Knowing when to fight for high-value loot or avoid a fight can make a huge difference.<li>
<li>Team Dynamics: In duo or squad modes, working with teammates is essential. Players must communicate and share resources to increase their chances of winning.</li><hr>

Monetization and Progression
<li>While Zombs Royale is free-to-play, it includes microtransactions for cosmetics such as skins, emotes, and accessories. The game also has a Battle Pass system that rewards players with exclusive items for completing challenges and leveling up through the season.

Players can also earn XP through matches, which unlocks new rewards like skins, outfits, and other cosmetic items. This system encourages players to keep playing and customizing their avatars without affecting gameplay balance.
